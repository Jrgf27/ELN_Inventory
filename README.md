# ELN_Inventory
Making a ELN + Inventory systems using Django

This project has been my way of continuously learning Django while improving the existing codebase. 
The project is currently functional and next steps involve major code refactoring and creation of test cases for each section of the project, before any other section is created.

Any new features will abide by TDD development and to PyLint specifications.
